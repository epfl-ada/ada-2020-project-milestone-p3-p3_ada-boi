**Title: Influence of housing conditions on education and health of children**  

**Abstract**  
While the original paper explores the effects of a treatment (Piso Firme) on children health and household happiness, it fails to take into account the default conditions: how is the health of certain demographics impacted by their living and housing conditions. We propose to study the effect of housing on certain indicators, such as happiness, health and education. To do so, we plan on taking the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF), which recenses households throughout the USA, along with the demographics and health parameters of the inhabitants.

**Research questions**
1. Which life outcomes do general housing conditions (such as size, crowding, income, programs...) influence the most (education, happiness or health)? 
2. Is there a correlation between precarious housing and certain health conditions? (*health status rather?*)
3. In what ways do living conditions affect children scholarship (if they do) ? Which age group is most impacted ?

**Proposed dataset**
1. Urban Institute, and Child Trends. National Survey of Americaâ€™s Families (NSAF), 2002. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2007-10-03. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04582.v1 \
We chose the 2002 census as it represents a similar timeframe to the Piso Firme project, which probably helps to smoothe out potential period-related discrepencies (for example, maybe the 2008 crisis had an effect on the relationships we want to determine, and taking a post-2008 census would be misleading).
We will restrict our study to the Focal Child Data and the Household Data.
2. Census data and health questionnaire from the original paper. *really?*

**Methods**\
We will divide the children in three age groups in order to study which group is influenced the most for different parameters. Each child will be linked to his/her household.
The idea is first to do some visualization of the data for the variables of interest. Then, we will perform linear regression in order to study in more details the impact of different housing variables on schooling, health and happiness.
