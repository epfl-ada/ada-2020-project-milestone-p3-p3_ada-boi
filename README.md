**Title: Influence of housing conditions on life and health**  

**Abstract**  
While the original paper explores the effects of a treatment (Piso Firme) on children health and household happiness, it fails to take into account the default conditions: how is the health of certain demographics impacted by their living and housing conditions. We propose to study the effect of housing on certain indicators, such as happiness (prÃ©sent dans le dataset?), health and even scholarly outcome. To do so, we plan on taking the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF), which recenses households throughout the USA, along with the demographics/health parameters of the inhabitants.

**Research questions**
1. Which life outcomes do general housing conditions influence the most(education level/happiness)? 
2. Is there a correlation between precarious housing and certain health conditions?
3. Gentrification(1998->2000)?

**Proposed datasets**
1. National Survey of America's Families (NSAF), , 2002 (ICPSR 4582). We chose 2002 as it represents a similar timeframe to the Piso Firme project, which probably helps to smooth out potential period-related discrepencies (for example, maybe the 2008 crisis had an effect on the relationships we want to determine, and taking a post-2008 census would be misleading).
2. Census data and health questionnaire from the original paper.

**Organization within team**  
We will try to alternate the days on which we work on the project. ??? chelou un peu
