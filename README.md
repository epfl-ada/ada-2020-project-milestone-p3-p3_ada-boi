**Title: Influence of housing conditions on education, health and happiness**  

**Abstract**  
While the original paper explores the effects of a treatment (Piso Firme program) on children health and household happiness, it fails to take into account the default conditions: how is the health of certain demographics impacted by their living and housing conditions. We propose to study the effect of housing on certain indicators, such as happiness, health and education. To do so, we plan on using the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF), which recenses a large number of households throughout the USA, along with the demographics and health parameters of the inhabitants.\
From this dataset we can extract a number of interesting variables for housing conditions and environment (such as size, crowding, income, living arrangement, social programs, etc), happiness (e.g. mental health scale, social behavior), health (e.g. current status, doctor visits) and education (e.g. school engagement, performance, absenteeism).


**Research questions**
1. Which living conditions affect which life outcomes (education, health or happiness) the most?

2. What is the effect of precarious housing on health (both physical and mental) and school involvement for children?

3. Following-up on school involvement: which age group (children or adolescents) is most impacted ?

**Proposed dataset**\
Urban Institute, and Child Trends. National Survey of Americaâ€™s Families (NSAF), 2002. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2007-10-03. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04582.v1 \
We chose the 2002 census as it represents a similar timeframe to the Piso Firme project, which probably helps to smoothe out potential period-related discrepencies (for example, maybe the 2008 crisis had an effect on the relationships we want to determine, and taking a post-2008 census would be misleading).\
We will restrict our study to the Focal Child Data and the Household Data.

**Methods**\
We will divide the children into three age groups in order to study which group is influenced the most for different parameters. Each person of interest will be linked to his/her household.\
The idea is first to do some visualization of the data for the variables of interest. Then, we will perform linear regression in order to study in more details the impact of different housing variables on schooling, health and happiness.
We are also planning on using a propensity score matching (PSM) in order to evaluate certain treatment effects on subpopulations.

**Proposed timeline**
- Week 1 : Data pre-processing and data visualization
- Week 2 : PSM and regression models
- Week 3 : Results analysis & presentation

**Organization within team**  \
Each of us will focus on a subject of interest that could be influenced by housing conditions. \
Alan : education data, propensity score establishment \
Estelle : health and happiness data, population matching \
We will also regularly review each other's work and add ameliorations if needed.
